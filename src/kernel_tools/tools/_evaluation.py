"""The neutral contracts every benchmark adapter emits and the tree stores.

One shape across benchmark frameworks (flashinfer today, SOL/kernelbench later):
`TaskSpec` describes the task stored in memory, and `Evaluation`
reports a benchmark run (stored per tree node). Each adapter converts its native
fixtures/results into these, so nothing above the adapter sees native types.

The split that keeps these clean: an adapter returns one `WorkloadResult` per
workload (the leaf), and one shared `aggregate()` folds the leaves into the
stored `Evaluation` — so the scoring rule (geomean, representative pick, failure
histogram) is the harness's, identical across adapters, not re-derived per
adapter.
