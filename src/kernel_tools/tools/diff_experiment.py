"""Diff a logged experiment against the current working kernel.

Lets the agent see what it has changed in the working kernel relative to a
logged experiment, without checking anything out. To compare two logged
experiments, check one out and diff against the other. Optional filename
narrows the diff to a single file; otherwise all files on either side are
diffed.
